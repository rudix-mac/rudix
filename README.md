What is Rudix?
==============

Rudix is a build system target on macOS (OS X) with minor support to OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Linux. The build system (also called "ports") provides step-by-step instructions for building third-party software, entirely from source code.

Rudix provides more than a pure framework, it comes with packages, precompiled software bundled up in a nice format (files `*.pkg`) for easy installation on your Mac.

Similar projects or alternatives to Rudix are [MacPorts][1], [Fink][2], [pkgsrc][3] and [Homebrew][4].
