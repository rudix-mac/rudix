Text mode  World Wide Web (WWW) client

Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or any other character-cell display.  It will display Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp, finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.  Current versions of Lynx run on Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to establish information systems intended primarily for local access.  Lynx has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  Lynx can also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.
