Finds and then operates on files

The findutils package contains programs which will help you locate files on your system.  The find utility searches through a hierarchy of directories looking for files which match a certain set of criteria (such as a filename pattern).  The xargs utility builds and executes command lines from standard input arguments (usually lists of file names generated by the find command).
